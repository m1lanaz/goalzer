# Goalzer

A work-in-progress of a website which allows you to enter in your new goals, using [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2020/02/24/why-we-fail-to-reach-goals-our-brains-begin-with-one-focus-but-closing-the-deal-requires-another-study-suggests/) article.

With each goal it allows you to:
*Enter in why you want to achieve your goal
*Enter in how long it will take for you to achieve your goal
*Enter in how you will achieve your goal
*If your goal is a daily goal then it will give you a prompt of questions depending on if you failed or succeeded with your goal.
